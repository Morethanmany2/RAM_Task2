#TASK DESCRIPTION

RAM(Random Access Memory) is a form of memory used in the computer system. It is a faster but volatile type of memory. It can store memory only when the hard drive is on that makes performing read and write operations fast and easy. In this task, I used verilog HDL in an EDA playground simulator to design a single port RAM. This Single Port RAM performs read and write operations each at one clock cycle. The write enable signal decides which operation is to be performed.
